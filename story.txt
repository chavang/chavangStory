Cha Vang looked at the powerful piano in his hands and felt happy.
He walked over to the window and reflected on his welcoming surroundings. He had always loved warm Five Guys with its different, dripping door. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel happy.

He though the five guys burgers were the best in the world. They were massive and were always paired with great fries. He always argued with his friends over whether five guys or mcdonald's had better food.
His freinds argue that mcdonald has more variety, for example they have chicken nuggets and breakfast and they have been here more than the other brands, including five guys.
